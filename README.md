# Classical Ciphers
The goal is to build a Java program that can be used to try out several classical encryption methods.
Currently each cipher module runs on its own but the plan is to build a central main file where the user can decide which cipher (method) to use.

Current ciphers:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher

Suggestions are always welcomed!
