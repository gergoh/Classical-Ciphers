# Classical Ciphers
The goal of this project is to build a Java package that can be used to try out several classical encryption methods.
Currently Main file is for running tests and building new ciphers into the encrypters.classical package.

Current ciphers:
- Caesar Cipher (encrypt / decrypt)
- VigenÃ¨re Cipher (encrypt / decrypt)
- Playfair Cipher (encrypt)
- Rail Fence Cipher (encrypt -> in progress)
- Stream Cipher (planned)
- DES encryption (planned)
- ROT13 Cipher (planned)

Suggestions are always welcomed!
