# Classical Ciphers
The goal is to build a Java program that can be used to try out several classical encryption methods.
Currently Main file is for running tests and building new ciphers into the encrypters.classical package.

Current ciphers:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher
- Playfair Cipher (in progress)

Suggestions are always welcomed!
